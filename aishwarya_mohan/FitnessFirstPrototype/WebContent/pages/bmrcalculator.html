                <h3>What is BMR?</h3>
                <p>The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate
                    environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much
                    gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital
                    organs, which include the heart, lungs, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex
                    organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, upwards of ~70% of total energy (calories) burned each
                    day is due to upkeep. Physical activity makes up ~20% of expenditure and ~10% is used for the
                    digestion of food, also known as thermogenesis.
                </p>
                <h3>Calculating TDEE</h3>
                <p>
                    Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is an estimation of how many calories you burn per day
                    when exercise is taken into account. It is calculated by first figuring out your Basal Metabolic
                    Rate, then multiplying that value by an activity multiplier.

                    Since your BMR represents how many calories your body burns when at rest, it is necessary to adjust
                    the numbers upwards to account for the calories you burn during the day. This is true even for
                    those with a sedentary lifestyle. Our TDEE calculator uses the best formulas and displays your
                    score in a way that's easy to read and meaningful.
                </p>
                <h3>TDEE and Weight Loss</h3>
                <p> There are a phenomenal number of weight-loss programs out there; however, the fundamental
                    requirement to losing weight remains simple: To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than
                    you consume. By calculating your TDEE, you can identify the maximum number of calories you can
                    consume if you wish to lose weight. If you consistently consume fewer calories than the TDEE, you
                    will enter negative calories, and your body will find the energy it needs to sustain your
                    activities from your fat stores.

                <h3>Significance Of BMR</h3>
                <p> 1. The determination of BMR is the principal guide for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid
                    disorders.
                    <br>
                    2. If BMR is less than 10% of the normal, it indicates moderate hypothyroidism. In severe
                    hypothyroidism, the BMR may be decreased to 40 to 50 percent below normal.
                    <br>
                    3. BMR aids to know the total amount of food or calories required to maintain body weight.
                    <br>
                    4. The BMR is low in starvation, under nutrition, hypothalamic disorders, Addison’s disease and
                    lipoid nephrosis.
                    <br>
                    5. The BMR is above normal in fever, diabetes insipidus, leukemia and polycythemia.

            </div>
            <div class="bmrvsbmi">
                <h3>BMR vs BMI</h3>
                <p> The abbreviations BMI and BMR sound similar, but they stand for two separate things. Your BMI, or
                    body mass index, is a number calculated from your height and weight which is then used to assess
                    your body composition. Your BMR, or basal metabolic rate, is the number of calories you burn when
                    your body is at rest. Although the two terms are independent of each other, your BMI may indirectly
                    affect your BMR.
                </p>
                <p>Several factors affect your basal metabolic rate and body fat composition is one of them. Those
                    with more muscle mass tend to burn more calories at rest because muscle tissue requires more
                    calories to maintain than fat tissue. Although BMI and BMR are not directly related, if you have a
                    high BMI because of a high body fat percentage, your BMR may be lower. If you have a high BMI
                    because of a large amount of muscle mass, your BMR may be increased. Additionally, if you are
                    overweight, but very active, that doesn't mean you'll necessarily have a low BMR.

                    BMI and BMR are guidelines that allow nutrition and medical professionals to make educated
                    determinations about your body composition and calorie burn, but every person should still be
                    viewed individually. Check with your doctor or a dietitian to if you have questions about your own
                    BMI and BMR.
                </p>
                <p>You can also find out your BMI using our <a href="bmicalculator.html">BMI calculator</a>
                </p>

            <div class="note">
                Please note:
                *The results given by this bmr calculator should be used only as a guide and should not replace medical
                advice. Please bear in mind that, when interpreting the results of this body mass index calculator,
                other factors such as muscle structure and ethnic origin should be considered. For example, a person
                with a lot of muscle might have a higher bmr, when their body is actually perfectly healthy, due to the
                fact that muscle weighs more than fat.

                Athletes can have muscular builds. Since muscle weighs more than fat, bmr may overestimate body fat for
                these individuals.
                Older adults may have lost muscle. In this case, bmr may underestimate body fat.


                Always speak to a Doctor or health professional for advice and guidance before making any dramatic
                changes to your lifestyle.
